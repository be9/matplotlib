To build the matplotlib users guide, you will need to 

  * PIL - some of the examples use it to show how to interact with
    matplotlib and PIL (cut and paste of the following if you are on a
    linux-like box and are a sudoer)

      cd /var/tmp/
      wget http://effbot.org/downloads/Imaging-1.1.4.tar.gz
      tar xvfz Imaging-1.1.4.tar.gz
      cd Imaging-1.1.4/
      cd libImaging/
      ./configure ; make
      cd ..
      sudo python setup.py install

  * add the styles dir to your TEXINPUTS environment variable

  * Generate the figures 
     
     > make figs

    Verify that the figures in the figures dir are built.  Verify also
    that the *.dat files in data were built.

  * build the docs

    > make dvi
    > make pdf
