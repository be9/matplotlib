The html for the matplotlib web site is generated using yaptu, a
simple (71 lines of code!) but powerful templating engine

  http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/52305

All of the web pages are templates, eg, index.html.template in which I
combine arbitrary python data structures with yaptu templating.

process_docs.py is a script to generate the pydocs for the class
   library, and munge the generated output into a format suitable for
   inclusion into the web page.  

convert.py is the workhorse that runs all the templates and generates
  the html with the appropriate headers and footers.

screenshots/makeshots.py is a script that creates all the screenshots
  that can be generated dyamically (some cannot be because, for
  example, they are screenshots of figure windows with the navigation
  toolbar).  Caution, the mri and pcolor screenshots currently take a
  long time to generate because the are high resolution.  Best run on
  a fast computer!

So in a nutshell, here is what you need to do to generate the docs.

  0) Build the matplotlib html class documentation with Make htmldocs
  
  1) Make sure the CVS matplotlib tree is in your PYTHONPATH and 
     > cd htdocs

  2) > python process_docs.py

  3) > python convert.py

  4) > cd screenshots
  
  5) > python makeshots.py  # this could take a while for pcolor and  mri

  6) Point your browser at file:///your/dev/matplotlb/htdocs/index.html

You can also run

  # in the matplotlib dev root (doesn't rebuild screenshots)
  > make htmldocs
